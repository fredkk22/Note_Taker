## Description

This Module 11 Challenge was to create a note taker that would allow the user to read, write, save, and delete notes on the application.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about Express.js, using heroku, database files, read, write, and append file functions, and different types of API fetch requests.

I was able to learn everything I listed above, and look forward to putting this type of logic to use in future projects.
